#+title: Learning jupyter through emacs-jupyter

* Initial configuration
** Which python?
*** conda.el
First we make sure that we're running the correct python. This is done via
doom-emacs's =+conda flag= for python, which enables the package =conda.el=. We
run =M-x conda-env-activate= and choose the appropriate conda environment.
Alternatively, simply run the following code block with =C-c C-c=:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(conda-env-activate "air-quality")
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Switched to conda environment: /opt/homebrew/Caskroom/miniconda/base/envs/air-quality/

*** jupyter-python, sessions
Just to double check that all's well...
#+begin_src jupyter-python :session py
import sys
sys.exec_prefix
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: /opt/homebrew/Caskroom/miniconda/base/envs/air-quality

We should, of course, make sure that our conda environment has all the relevant
packages that we will need below.
** Inserting code blocks
*** TODO org-tempo? yasnippets? custom configuration?

* Getting started
** Sampling from a Gaussian
*** imports
Let's get a simple example up and running. Let's sample from a Gaussian
distribution and plot the results. First the relevant imports:
#+begin_src jupyter-python :session py
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

*** TODO hiding empty results
Notice that this code block has no output. We should configure org-babel so that
empty code blocks display no =#+RESULTS=.

*** TODO naming code blocks, are there tags? execution order?

*** sampling, header-args
Next, we sample from the distribution:
#+begin_src jupyter-python :session py :var n=1000
mu, sigma = 0, 1
sample = np.random.normal(mu, sigma, n)
print(f"Took {len(sample)} samples.")
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Took 1000 samples.

Notice that we provided the sample size as an argument in the header of the code block.

*** plotting, inline-images
Finally we construct and display a histogram overlaid against the distribution.
Again we use header arguments... just for fun, really. It'd probably be more
readable as constants clearly defined in one place.
#+begin_src jupyter-python :session py :var bins=30
count, bins, ignored = plt.hist(sample, bins, density=True)
plt.plot(bins, 1/(sigma * np.sqrt(2 * np.pi)) *
         np.exp( - (bins - mu)**2 / (2 * sigma**2) ),
         linewidth=2, color='r')
plt.show()
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
[[file:./.ob-jupyter/4237aafbc9f595cc0ef91ed1abf78b2f1cc06099.png]]

The resulting image is served as as org-mode link, which should be automatically
shown as an inline image. Looks great!
